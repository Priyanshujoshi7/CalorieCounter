Calorie Counter
This is a Calorie Counter application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was developed to practice and improve my skills in form validation.

Features
Calorie Tracking: Allows users to input food items and their respective calorie counts.
Form Validation: Ensures that users enter valid data before submitting the form.
Calorie Summary: Displays a summary of total calories consumed based on the entries.
Responsive Design: The application is styled with CSS and adapts to different screen sizes.
How It Works
Users can enter the name of a food item and the number of calories it contains.
The form validates the input to ensure all fields are filled out correctly.
Once validated, the data is displayed in a list, and the total calories are updated.
Users can see a summary of their calorie intake and manage their entries.
Learning Outcomes
This project helped me enhance my understanding of:

Form Validation: Implementing checks to ensure the accuracy and completeness of user input.
JavaScript Logic: Handling data input, processing, and updating the UI.
Responsive Design: Creating a user-friendly interface that works well on different devices.
